    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;" align="justify"> Over the past years, the term Internet of Things (IoT) has grown in popularity among the users, not only hyped them but also created many development opportunities among the industries. The physical objects linked with the sensors, software applications and other modes of technologies share the data over the Internet—in this article, considering the business IoT preparing layers stack, correlation of cloud, fog and edge layers: the most security challenges and their answers. As the Industry of the web keeps on developing, there are contemplations and difficulties with the significance of the insurance and security of the IoT. Digital assaults, for example, man-in-the-middle and DDoS attacks, are usual dangers to the IoT. This article also discusses cyber security threats and the Cyber AI method to overcome them.

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES
    </h3>
    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;" align ="justify"> Not a day goes by when there is a data breach or ransomware attack. What concerns this is that with the prevalence of IoT and Industrial IoT, all these connected devices are all over the place, and some of these devices are not manufactured with security in mind. The World Economic Forum defines this period as a paradigm shift across industry verticals in which new technologies are fusing the physical, digital, and biological worlds. This fusing of physical and digital technologies, a significant trend that underlines these momentous advances, is also the convergence of informational and operational technologies, or the IT/OT convergence. A traditional IT environment - including computers, servers and a whole range of IoT devices- can comprise the conventional cyber ecosystem. But when this IT environment begins communicating with an OT environment, such as manufacturing equipment or machines or other sensors and operational technologies, this becomes a cyber-physical ecosystem. A cyber-physical ecosystem, or other sensors and active technologies, becomes a cyber-physical ecosystem. A cyber-physical ecosystem. Where the door is open to cyber-physical threats, that is, attacks that gain an initial hold in an IT environment but then move over to disrupt operations in the OT environment. For example, an attack originating in the inbox or anywhere else on an IT network can then go on to disrupt the processes directly on the factory floor. And this is precisely what happened recently with the EKANS ransomware. So, in June 2020, when Honda announced that it was halting industrial operations in factories across the globe, spanning everywhere from India to Ohio, the security industry became acutely aware of new risks to industrial processes. Honda was hit with a form of ransomware which frequently targets corporate networks in attempts to either hold data hostage or otherwise forcibly interrupt critical business practices and then demand the ransom. However, this strain had a unique twist. Namely, EKANS was one of the strains of ransomware 'caught in the wild' that mainly targets processes related to industrial operations in its kill chain. This EKANS ransomware directly targeted vulnerabilities in industrial control systems. Or ICS, the computers that control manufacturing and other physical processes- in its targeting of 65 ICS mechanisms in its 'Kill List,' the list of methods the ransomware interrupts to dispute industrial operations.

    <blockquote class="text-primary p-3 font-italic" style="border-left: 4px solid black; line-height: 2;">The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a cyberattack that causes the servers to refuse to provide services to genuine clients. The DDOS attack can be classified into two types:
     <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
      Flooding attacks: In this attack, the hacker sends massive traffic to the server, which the server cannot handle. And hence, the server stops functioning. This attack type is usually executed using automated programs that continuously send packets to the server. </ul>
       <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”> Crash attacks: In this type, the hackers exploit a bug on the server, resulting in the system crashing, and hence, the server cannot provide service to the clients. </blockquote>

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark"> SOLUTION TO CLOUD SECURITY
    </h3>

    <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;" align ="justify"> <u> Solution to secure your cloud? </u> Ensuring that organizations care about the cloud is about a couple of things - continually conveying the correct help and information. This can't be something that happens a portion of the time. It needs to occur for every solicitation. Actualizing approval and verification to ensure that solitary, the perfect individuals approach assets and data, proactively forestalling dangers since agitators are continually advancing and robust cloud security permits you to be defensive instead of simply responsive. Following administrative prerequisites of their Industry- - not all, but rather to an ever-increasing extent, organizations should have been agreeable, in this way that is one thing you must remember of furthermore, flexibility and the board so inside groups is sceptered to follow up on the parts they're chargeable for and may control. To ensure those regions are covered, we should solidify cloud security. Make sure the framework falls into three fundamental degrees of duty - assets you're responsible for, things your provider is answerable for, and something you're each liable for their foundation, framework, and application-level security. The client is liable for making sure about their applications, such as fitting proper verification, approval, and recognizable proof for clients in their framework. Google Cloud claims to make sure about the stage, which deals with the actual machines and data focuses, your application, and information use. Finally, below structure security is a shared obligation; any place Google Cloud Provides devices to help the client deal with their VMs, organizations and information access needs. Let's investigate this inside and out, hence what does one need to do to make sure about your cloud setting without anyone else? There are three fundamental security activities you'll go for solidifying your framework stage and infra activities, protection activities, and expository activities. Framework and stage moves are steps to ensure the hidden equipment, or virtual equipment, is secure. There are two parts of security, which Google oversees, and framework security, which the client manages, yet Google Cloud gives instruments to help. Stages moves are steps Google makes to make sure about the equipment and programming instruments accessible over the web they give to clients. This can be anything from making sure about server farms to recreating information across areas to ensure it's accessible, even in case of cataclysmic events someplace. Framework activities, then again, are the means the client takes to make sure about the cloud-based pay-more only as costs arise administrations worship stockpiling, systems administration, and virtualization that Google gives. This may be something from consistently changing settings during a heap balancer to picking a more secure VM case type of utilization.
The resulting classification of activity is safeguarded activities. This occurs at the apparatus level and incorporates things like Google Cloud personality, access to the board, and Google Character Aware Proxy, or IAP, to restrict who approaches what inside your framework. In this way, google gives tooling to the clients to help plot access levels. At that point, there are expository activities. You are bringing these means to follow down penetrates and stop them rapidly or, in a perfect world, to spot and stop vindictive conduct before a break-even happens. One of the best practices here is work and perception. By logging movement inside your framework and fitting programmed and manual observations of that information, you'll be alarmed of dubious action before it's past the point of no return. Here again, Google gives tooling to help clients screen their surroundings.

    <blockquote class="text-primary p-3 font-italic" style="border-left: 4px solid black; line-height: 2;"> Access Risks in Cloud Security


      <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”> The man-in-the-middle attack intrudes on an existing connection, intersecting and modifying all network traffic between two devices, and intercepting and modifying all network traffic between two devices. If the intruder blocked an admin's traffic, he'd even be able to act on your system with all the privileges of your admin.
        
        Data Risks in cloud Security 

        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>  Protections for the first cloud security risk -access. But how much of a challenge is the second risk- data? How do we prevent problems with the data that is stored? There are many ways to get trapped here. Improper disclosure of info by employees. Imagine accidentally sending an email containing credit card or social security numbers. Your application could disseminate harmful data, sharing phishing URLs or malware, Or data could be stored somewhere without proper security protocols. What to do to stop? For our data's sake. Data represents what data gets stored and where it's located. It must be sure that it holds personally identifiable information, or PII, which is data that could potentially be used to identify a user. And even if it doesn't store sensitive information, it can't find where data is stored, which will not be very useful to the customers. </blockquote>

       <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">CONCLUSION
      </h3>

      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;" align ="justify"> This article examines numerous security and protection inside the setting of industrial data processing layers on cloud computing. That might be another processing worldview to create flexible assets at the organization's sting to close completion clients. Cloud computing is a popular computing paradigm that may give finished clients access to configurable assets on any gadget, anywhere, at any time. All through the previous years, cloud computing has been created dramatically. However, with the occasion of the Internet of Things, the hindrances (for example, high latency) of Cloud computing are bit by bit due to the significant distance between the cloud and end clients. Fog registering is intended to solve this drawback by stretching out the cloud to the edge of the organization. Specifically, fog computing introduces a transitional layer alluded to as fog intended to strategize the correspondence data between the cloud and end clients. Thus, fog computing is commonly considered a partner degree extension of Cloud computing. Inside the paper, for various reasons, the Cloud computing worldview can't fulfil bound necessities (for example, low latency and jitter, setting mindfulness, quality help) that are vital for some applications (for example, vehicular networks, expanded reality). Different standards, fog haze computing, mobile edge processing, and portable Cloud computing have arisen lately to fill these necessities. Talk about security issues like secure data stockpiling, secure calculation and organization security. Moreover, feature protection issues in information security, use safety, and equipment and programming framework security can cause new speculation to adjust to new difficulties and chances. </div>
